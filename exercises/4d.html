    <p>Hello, world!</p>
    <p>Today I went to university , I skip one class with few of my classmates because of quiz. Time spent with them was beautiful, there names are sahaab , rameela and munaza . I am very inspired of sahaab , she is matured and have great qualities , she has a great confidence and knowledge , she knows how to spent her time wisely , not like me spending all the day on phone watching insta reels , facebook posts and youtube. I need continuous motivation to focus on my study/work. I know i have capability to do my work but i'm just wasting one day after an other, i'm not a fast learner but i'm not even trying to learn new skills :) , i'm worried about myself but at the same time I don't even do something , I just need continuous motivation and someone who can polish my inner side or inner skills.</p>
